Hey! This is just a quick update to let anyone who is interested know that I have finished my first semester of work on my final year project! I have two things to provide to interested readers:

  - My report. This has a lot of technical analysis and design plans for my project.
  - My presentation. This is embedded below! Warning, information overload.

My report is available [here](https://mega.nz/#!gBA3xbKT!13-F_gkN535cXwZ_F8Ipqg9nSFOW3eTQtZEYiZFRaI8).

And my presentation is available [here](/fyp-presentation), and embedded in an iframe below! :)

<iframe class="block-element" src="/fyp-presentation" height="400px" width="100%"></iframe>

I also have a demo application which has the synchronisation functionality working, [available here](https://github.com/thekemkid/youtube-party).

That's all! Thanks for reading. :)

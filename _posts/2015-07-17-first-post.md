I just completed my blog! yay! I can now start to create blog posts and share them with friends and foes alike :D This post is the inauguration post for my blog, and I think I'm going to take a leaf from [this guys post][1], and make an indepth post explaining how I created this blog, using tools like jekyll, disqus and even more. I wouldn't have been able to make a blog half as good as what I have right now if it wasn't for that post. 

But, before I go too far down the road of talking tech, I would like to clearly define the mission statement of my blog, and what I would like to do with it.

### Mission statement, Meta talk and My plans

My mission statement is a very clear, concise sentence. I want to make a hub for my personal thoughts and ramblings, and I shall try my hardest to make it so those rants, raves and rambles are cohesive, can help people, and/or they will motivate them to **do some good**. These posts are how I can rant when I just *can't* figure out how the fuck I am supposed to get elasticsearch to run natively on linux for a project I am working on, only to give up and switch to the docker container. They are are how I can write posts laughing at the fact I was frustrated for 3 days trying to get elasticsearch to work once, when I then fixed it in 60 seconds just deciding to run `docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 elasticsearch`. They are how I can connect to world and get outside my own head. I have lots of thoughts knocking around up there.

Occasionally, I will break out my nerdy knowledge and school the world in the lore of some fictional universe I have been immersing myself in, too. I would like that. I would like that a lot.

I plan on make this a blog that shows the world my path from junior software developer to whatever I may become, where ever I end up.


### How I made this blog (Protip:Jekyll)
I used a cool technology called [Jekyll][3].

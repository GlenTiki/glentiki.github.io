I just completed my personal website and blog! Yay! I can now start to create blog posts and share them with friends and foes alike :D If you stumbled across these rambles by accident and want to read more about me, check out the [about me section][1].This post is the inauguration post for my blog so I would like to clearly define the mission statement of my blog, and what I would like to do with it.

### Mission statement, Meta talk and My plans

My blog is for my friends, tech enthusiasts and developers who might want a window into my life, or for those who may need an indepth how-to reference post on a topic I am familar with. I will try to keep it clear, helpful and professional where needed, and I will try to let my personality shine through where appropriate. Like right here! :D

My motivation for this blog is twofold, the first reason is simple, I need proper personal professional representation, and the second reason is that I spend most of my day talking tech, making things with tech and just generally _thinking_ all things tech, so I should probably put those thoughts somewhere where I can refer to easily. I can barely remember what I had for dinner yesterday, let alone what I was thinking about yesterday, so I need this. It will be my place of reference for tech things I worked on, which I think are pretty cool, but way too complicated to keep in my head giong forward. Enter glenkeane.me, my new journal and encyclopedia of reference on yesterdays forgotten thoughts.

How-to posts are going to be essential to my blog as well, as I am a very practical learner (or remember-er, if I am re-reading a post). I want my blog to be a quality reference which I can be proud of. And the only way to do that, is to get blogging!

#### Not just for serious talk...

But it doesn't have to be all super serious with no fun talk, I also plan on chipping in with my thoughts about some current events which are causing a stir, talking about gaming, online life, comedy and I might even put together a clickbait-y 'top 10 reasons why...' for fun. Blogging will be an activity that cuts into my pleasure time, so I will always try to keep it pleasurable by talking about things that interest me. :)

Thanks for reading, I hope this ramble has explained what I made this for, and what I plan on doing with it!

Hey! This is just a quick update to let anyone who is interested know that I have completely finished my final year project! I have two things to provide to interested readers:

  - My report. This is the final thesis for my college coursework!
  - A report I needed to do on the planning and requirements for the project.
  - A report I needed to do on the formal specification of how the project worked.
  - My first semster report.
  - My first semester presentation.
  - My designed poster.

My thesis is available [here](https://mega.nz/#!ZIhwQQpD!WpwyeIxzy4XxU0BZ9IcRMQp3xXr70sp5Dx9d0f61msw).

The report for the planning and requirements is [here](https://mega.nz/#!0UpSmKiC!iwkuYwltVh7MLWJYc7Tv3ZJFtTfJX7_xmoqj0lwafr4).

The report for the formal spec is [here](https://mega.nz/#!JcRVhKTK!wz8OL7XPI-pO7MRKI6bbbq3_x28Ji2NUAPVQuKiC22U).

The report from first semester is available [here](https://mega.nz/#!gBA3xbKT!13-F_gkN535cXwZ_F8Ipqg9nSFOW3eTQtZEYiZFRaI8).

The presentation from first semester is available [here](/fyp-presentation).

The application used to be live at mediasync.io, but I eventually tore it down. The codebase is [available here](https://github.com/thekemkid/mediasync).

I was nominated for an award for the best final year project from Sun Life, but unfortunately I didn't win it.

And with that, I'm now finished college! That's all for that chapter of my life! :)

I'll be starting with NearForm full time again soon. I'm excited to get back into the swing of things!

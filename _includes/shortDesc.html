<p class='justified'>
	I am a 21 year old software developer from Waterford, Ireland. I am currently on an internship in <a href='www.nearform.com'>nearForm,</a> where I am working with node.js, and working on microservices architectures. I also love gaming and often spend my evenings playing games like Minecraft, Skyrim or GTAV, or hacking away on whatever takes my fancy.

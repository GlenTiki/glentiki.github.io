	I am a 20-something year old Senior Software Engineer from Waterford, Ireland. I work for a local development company called <a href='www.nearform.com'>Threefold Systems</a> and previously worked at a web consultancy called <a href='www.nearform.com'>NearForm.</a> I generally work with high performance Node.js, Golang, scalable MicroService architectures and moonlight in the devops world using Kuberenetes or OpenShift. I also like to play with Rust whenever I get the chance. I'm an honors graduate in Applied Computing from Waterford institute of technology. I also love gaming and often spend my evenings playing games, or hacking away on whatever takes my fancy.

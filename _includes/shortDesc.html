	I am a 21 year old software developer from Waterford, Ireland. I am currently A student in Waterford Institute of Technology studying Applied Computing. I am in my final year and can't wait to get to work. I have done an internship in <a href='www.nearform.com'>nearForm,</a> where I worked with node.js, and microservices architectures. I also love gaming and often spend my evenings playing games like Fallout 4, Skyrim or GTAV, or hacking away on whatever takes my fancy.

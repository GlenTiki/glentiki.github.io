<p class='justified'>
	I am a 21 year old software developer from Waterford, Ireland. I am currently on an internship in <a href='www.nearform.com'>nearForm,</a> where I am working with node.js, and working on microservices architectures. I also love gaming and often spend my evenings playing games like Minecraft, Skyrim or GTAV, or hacking away on whatever takes my fancy.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		I am currently working on <a href='http://github.com/thekemkid/youtube-party'>a video player</a> built with websockets, which plays videos from youtube. This project allows people to watch videos in sync with their friends, or let people control the playback from their personal devices.
		<br>
		The idea behind it is that when you are hanging out with friends and you all want to play music, you can all whip out your phones and add songs to the queue. But, using websockets, it was super easy to extend this to keep sync in playback across multiple clients. So, now, it can be used as a music player, or just to watch some videos with friends! :)
		<br>
		As always, there's even a relevant XKCD comic:

	<li>
		I am the primary developer of the nTrace framework, a tracing framework developed by the company I work at, <a href='http://www.nearform.com'>nearForm.</a> Tracing tools are tools which have a very small impact on the running of your programs, but can handle large amounts of data or events. Lttng, the tracing tool which nTrace was built upon, was originally developed for low-overhead tracing of the Linux kernel. This tool is designed to handle thousands and thousands of events per second, without any noticable impact on the performance of the program being traced. nearForm recognised that this is a tool which could be put to great use, but the current lttng tooling is very low level.
		<br>
		After identifying the tool, I was made work on developing tools to make it easy to use lttng with node.js. nTrace is the culmination of this work, and is still under heavy development. If you wish to check out the current nTrace stuff, you can see it on <a href='www.github.com/nearform'>nearForms github account.</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		I maintain several useful utility modules which you can use in node.js. To see all the modules I work on, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/~thekemkid'>click here</a>

		I also <a href='http://www.wit.ie/news/science/the_war_of_the_web_designers'>created the first WIT Hackaton</a>!

<h3>Interests:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Open Source – While working in nearForm, and contributing to node.js, I came to love and enjoy being an active member of open source community. I am passionate about open-source, and I couldn't work in a setting where there was no possibility of me contributing to open-source.
	</li>
	<li>
		Technology – I'm kind of a Nerd, if you haven't guessed. I got my first PC when I was 6, and I've been hacking ever since!
	</li>
	<li>
		Video games and Gaming – When I got that first computer, I needed something to do to occupy my time... enter video games! :D
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experience:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>2014/2015: Software developer in <a href='http://www.nearform.ie/'>nearForm</a></h4>
		<p class='muted'>
			nearForm are a leading global consultancy for using node.js and microservices in the enterprise. Some of their clients were Conde nast, DPD, Fandango, CoderDojo and London School of Marketing. While I was there, I worked with node.js building large web applications for clients. I learned how to use microservices architectures and how they can be implemented at scale, and how to use some of the most modern tools for the job.
			<br>
			I gained experience writing native node.js addons using C++, as <a href='https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/702'>I added lttng, a set of tracing tools, directly into the node.js source code.</a> I also was the primary developer of nearForms tracing tools, which required a lot of native C++ code.
			<br>
			Other things of note which I worked on, and with, while in nearform are 
			<ul>
				<li>Using the <a href='http://github.com/atom/electron-framework'>Electron Framework</a> to make and distribute client applications.</li>
				<li>Using Express, and Socket.io on the back end.</li>
				<li>Using Lttng, and developing nTrace from scratch. This required I use C++, C and even some Python.</li>
				<li>Using Angular.js and Famo.us on the front end.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

</ul>

<h3>Education:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>2012-2016: <a href='http://www.wit.ie/courses/type/science/department_of_computing_maths_physics/bsc_hons_in_applied_computing'>BSc(Hons)Applied Computing</a> in <a href='http://www.wit.ie/'>Waterford institute of technology</a></h4>
		<p class='muted'>
			Applied Computing is the application of classic and leading edge computing concepts and technologies to different, current problem areas. These concepts and technologies can be applied at the different levels of system development from project analysis and implementation to project management. This course takes a practical approach to teaching computer science. 
			<br>
			While there, I studied programming fundamentals and best software development practices. Studied algorithms, data-structures, cryptography, computer architecture, operating systems, discrete maths, statistics, probability, calculus, information modelling, database design, artificial intelligence and choose to study the game development stream.

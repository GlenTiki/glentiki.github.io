		I worked on <a href='http://github.com/thekemkid/mediasync'>a media player platform</a> built with websockets, which plays videos from youtube & vimeo or soundcloud. This project allowed people to watch videos in sync with their friends, or let people control the playback from their personal devices.
		<br>
		The idea behind it is that when you are hanging out with friends and you all want to play music, you can all whip out your phones and add songs to the queue. But, using websockets, it was super easy to extend this to keep sync in playback across multiple clients. So, now, it can be used as a music player, or just to watch some videos with friends! :)

		As always, there's even a relevant XKCD comic:

		I was the primary developer of the nTrace framework, a tracing framework developed by <a href='http://www.nearform.com'>nearForm.</a> Tracing tools are tools which have a very small impact on the running of your programs, but can handle large amounts of data or events tracking. Lttng, the tracing tool which nTrace was built upon, was originally developed for low-overhead tracing of the Linux kernel. This tool is designed to handle thousands and thousands of events per second, without any noticable impact on the performance of the program being traced. nearForm recognised that this is a tool which could be put to great use, but the current lttng tooling is very low level.
		<br>
		After identifying the tool, I was made work on developing tools to make it easy to use lttng with node.js. nTrace was the culmination of this work. If you wish to check out the current nTrace stuff, you can see it on <a href='www.github.com/nearform'>nearForms github account.</a>

		I maintain several useful utility modules which you can use in node.js. To see all the modules I work on, <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/~thekemkid'>click here</a>
